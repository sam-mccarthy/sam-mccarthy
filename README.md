## hello!
i'm samuel mccarthy, a software engineer studying computer science (mathematics minor) at UMBC!  
open to any and all opportunities for growth / experiences  
currently occupied with revamping my homelab setup  

<details>
  <summary>homelab details</summary>

  currently running a Dell Optiplex 3050 (i3 7100 + 16gb DDR4)  
  driven by fedora server 40  
  
  managed using rootful docker (for network throughput, since other options are still experimental)  
  consists of a caddy reverse proxy towards a media stack (jellyfin, *arr) and some admin interfaces  
  accessed via wireguard using dns rewrites through adguard to caddy

  projects currently on hold while homelab is reworked  
  - cocoa - a general purpose discord bot, written in Rust using MongoDB - proof of concept, hosted on homelab using ghcr.io  
  - cumber - an MNIST database AI written in C, with no external libraries - WIP  
  - sandal - a CUDA-accelerated fractal generator - proof of concept, will be adding arbitrary precision and QOL eventually  
  - chipmu - a CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ with SDL - more or less done, could be a bit cleaner but i'd like to move onto another emulation project instead
