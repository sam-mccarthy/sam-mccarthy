## Hello!
I'm Sam, a software engineer studying Computer Science (Minor in Mathematics) at UMBC  
Open to any and all opportunities for growth and experience  
Feel free to reach me at samuelm4@umbc.edu!  
  
Currently revamping my homelab setup...  

<details>
  <summary>homelab details</summary>

  currently running a Dell Optiplex 3050 (i3 7100 + 16gb DDR4)  
  driven by fedora server 40  
  
  managed using rootful docker (for network throughput, since other options are still experimental)  
  consists of a caddy reverse proxy towards a media stack (jellyfin, *arr) and some admin interfaces  
  accessed via wireguard using dns rewrites through adguard to caddy
</details>

Projects (currently on hold while homelab is reworked):
  * cocoa: a general purpose discord bot, written in Rust using MongoDB - proof of concept, hosted on homelab using ghcr.io
  * cumber: an MNIST database AI written in C, with no external libraries - WIP
  * sandal: a CUDA-accelerated fractal generator - proof of concept, will be adding arbitrary precision and QOL eventually
  * chipmu: a CHIP-8 emulator written in C++ with SDL - more or less done, could be a bit cleaner but i'd like to move onto another emulation project instead
