<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Sam.</h1>
<h3>Who?</h3>
Caffeinated software engineer studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at UMBC.</br>
Passion for software built out of a very curious childhood filled with miscellaneous software antics.</br>
Feel free to reach out! You can find my LinkedIn on the sidebar of my profile.</br>
<h3>What are you doing?</h3>
Working at the Imaging Research Center @ UMBC, and (as a side project) on a physically-based ray-tracer (rust with wgpu).

If you want to find out more about me, personally, my <a href="https://samcc.me/about/">blog</a> might be a good place to start.

I should really update that soon...
